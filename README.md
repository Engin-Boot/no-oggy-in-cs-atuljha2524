Assignment-1

## Intention

This program intends to remove strings containing 'oggy' from a list of strings.
As oggy irritates me alot, he should be not be in the list.

## Method

I just used the simple for loop with variable i used as index.
Whenever a name starting with oggy is deleted i decrement i by
one so that it doesn't skip any word.
